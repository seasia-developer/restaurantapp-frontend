      para: "Transfer Units Painlessly - Franchise resales present a strong opportunity to replace disengaged or underperforming franchisees with motivated buyers who want to grow their business. As franchise agreements expire and your franchsiees retire, your brand will need new candidates to take over units. It is important to remember that the franchise resale candidate is not the same as your initial new franchise candidate. These are two different leads altogether, and the marketing your brand used to attract new franchisees will not attract the resale candidate. Resale candidates are less willing to take on risk and are more interested in the financial performance. As resale specialists, We Sell Restaurants understands how to attract the resale candidate. We develop a package of information on the franchise resale detailing the items that resale candidates care most about: the restaurant's historical financial performance.",

However, if you have existing units closing their doors, then your net restaurant growth will suffer. While We Sell Restaurants handles the transfer of resale units to new franchise candidates, your development team can focus on new unit growth. Similarly, your marketing team can focus on marketing to new franchise candidates while we attract the resale candidates. Franchise resale candidates also present an upsell opportunity for your brand development. These new franchisees may decide to buy more than one franchsie resale, or become interested acquiring a new unit. Ultimately, a resale program keeps your existing units open and allows your team to focus on opening new units. The result? Net restaurant growth.",

A resale program offers an attractive selling point for franchisees in providing an exit strategy. Any number of life changes or events could affect a franchisee's ability to keep a store, including death, divorce, or life-altering events. For the franchisee who can no longer hold onto a store, there is piece of mind when the franchisor can refer an expert to assist the franchisee in exiting the business. A formalized program with an expert like We Sell Restaurants also prevents closures by educating at-risk franchise locations about an exit strategy through resales. No need to stand idle while a unit fails when a structured resale process can save the unit and help franchisees exit smoothly. ",

                      Valuate - Restaurant valuation is a math problem with a

                      Due Diligence - This is where buyers will dig into
